# new-homepage
Custom, fully editable homepage for PCs.

## How to edit it?!?!?!??!!!111??!
Everything is described in the actual file.
Favicons can be easily extracted from Inspect Element, just look for ```<link rel="icon" type="image/png">``` in ```<head>```.

## Tested in...
Brave. That's all. It should work as soon as you set it as... well, a homepage.

### That's all for now.
Don't forget about wallpaper.png tho.
